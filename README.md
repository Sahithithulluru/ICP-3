**SUMMERY**: For the first question, I created a class employee and defined a static method average slary to calculate the  average salary of the employee. Created an instance of employee with the constructor arguments. For the full time employee I created a class called fullTime employee and inherited the employee class and created an instance of it, to print the result of number of employee and average salary I called the average salary method  and used the num_employee class variable.And for the 2nd question where we dealt with numpy I imported the numpy library. To generate the random vector  with values between 1 and 20 I used np.random.uniform function and printed it. To reshape the generated vector I have used reshape method from numpy. with arguments. (4,5). To return the max element along axis 1 I used the np.argmax function, to replace it with 0 by traversing the matrix i used the np.arange  method, and printed it.
